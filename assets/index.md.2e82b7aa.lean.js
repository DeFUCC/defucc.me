Mastering a craft is crucial for being full-fledged part of modern society. Aquiring a second craft is a little easier as you already have some real life experience. Skills tend to transfer and help learn more and faster. Once you master a number of skills you can get into the flow of switching and learning crafts that reinforce each other. Creating complex projects needs dozens of diverse tasks. Being able to take and complete all of them for at least a small project is the aquisition of creative independence. Multilateral universally experienced creators are more of an ideal. People exploring something they've been passing by before is the reality we can bring together."},"c":{"abbr":"C","title":"Cooperation","desc":"Sum of individual efforts to complete otherwise impossible tasks","color":"#f00","context":"It's a pleasure to work together on projects that really matter for the participants and others.

Our mission is to invent, test and refine new forms of human social activity that can benefit communities around the world.
