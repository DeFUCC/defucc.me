Mastering a craft is crucial for being full-fledged part of modern society. Aquiring a second craft is a little easier as you already have some real life experience. Skills tend to transfer and help learn more and faster. Once you master a number of skills you can get into the flow of switching and learning crafts that reinforce each other. Creating complex projects needs dozens of diverse tasks. Being able to take and complete all of them for at least a small project is the aquisition of creative independence. Multilateral universally experienced creators are more of an ideal. People exploring something they've been passing by before is the reality we can bring together."},"c":{"abbr":"C","title":"Cooperation","desc":"Sum of individual efforts to complete otherwise impossible tasks","color":"#f00","context":"It's a pleasure to work together on projects that really matter for the participants and others. Self-motivated and self-coordinated social action can accomplish almost anything. The more independent and universally experienced people are involved, the more complex projects may be realized collaboratively. Some may be there to learn, some will find new friends, some will just make use of the results at the end. It's so fun to build something for the good of others and us together."},"cr":{"abbr":"C","title":"Creativity","desc":"Conscious improvement of reality","color":"#070","context":"To really create something is to deliberately apply free efforts to increase the subjective world perfection.

We gather and synthesise a range of theoretical and practical experiences and aim to share these valuable insights with the world. Our mission is to invent, test and refine new forms of human social activity that can benefit communities around the world. We openly systematise this knowledge into a unified system that is not a dogma, but rather a starting point for those who wish to join us on the journey of transforming ourselves and the world around us."},"gifting":{"desc":"Gifting","context":"The purpose of the Foundation is to find ways to fund at least part of these endeavours in such a way that they remain open source and available to the general public. This means that anyone can get involved in the development of socio-cultural projects at any time. Eventually, the people around them and society as a whole will recognise the benefits of these enterprises, and new forms of meaningful connections between community sponsors and beneficiaries will emerge as new real-world social networks."},"discourse":{"desc":"Discourse","context":"In order to work in a coordinated way towards clear goals, it is important to understand each other well.
