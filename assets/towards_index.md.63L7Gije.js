These elements are deeply entrenched in our global civilization, and it requires a significant effort for an individual to resist these currents. However, upon halting and reversing our path, we can discover not just counterpoints to these principles, but the foundational elements of a new civilizational formula. It is becoming increasingly evident that the pursuit of narrow specialization, high competitiveness, and high consumption levels, while initially believed to satisfy our needs and provide personal happiness and harmony, are instead leading us to a dead end. These principles deprive us of flexibility, foster division, and fuel a destructive cult of consumption, leading to crises observable in today&#39;s financial sector, mass culture, overproduction, and pervasive extremism and wars.</p><p>To counteract these issues, we propose a new value system centered around three key principles: Universalization, Cooperation, and Creativity.</p><h2 id="universalization" tabindex="-1">Universalization <a class="header-anchor" href="#universalization" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Universalization&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Universalization is an active counter-argument to the idea that there are goals that can completely subjugate human life. It is an attempt to elevate our understanding of a successful person, making them not only a master of their narrow professional field and acquired property but also the owner of almost unlimited freedom to choose any activity at any time. Universalization is about cultivating a sincere interest in the new and unknown, providing access to an endless source of inspiration through self-development, and freeing individuals from the constraints of various life choices, allowing maximum scope for genuine impulses of human will.</p><h2 id="cooperation" tabindex="-1">Cooperation <a class="header-anchor" href="#cooperation" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Cooperation&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Cooperation in this context is about the unification of individuals to achieve certain goals, reaching a qualitatively new level. It isn&#39;t just a mechanical combination of elements with known functions and predictable capabilities. Instead, such a combination of efforts can instantly reveal the enormous potential hidden in each of us, especially when considering the synergistic effect of constant mutual learning and complementation of completely independent and multifaceted individuals.</p><h2 id="creativity" tabindex="-1">Creativity <a class="header-anchor" href="#creativity" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Creativity&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Creativity is the conscious improvement of the world. It is the highest level of manifestation of free human will, and it is creativity that guides each person on their path in life. The result of creativity is not a salary or future purchases, but a real, tangible outcome that belongs exclusively to its authors and corresponds to all their original preferences manifested in the creative process.</p><p>The principles of Universalization, Cooperation, and Creativity are not just strategies for individual growth, but they also offer significant adaptive potential to any community striving to survive, especially during times of crises and changing external conditions. They place knowledge and information at the forefront, because it is thanks to the wide exchange of knowledge between people striving for universality that their full implementation is possible.</p><h2 id="shift" tabindex="-1">Shift <a class="header-anchor" href="#shift" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Shift&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Humanity, in its historical journey, has attained unprecedented means for intensive knowledge exchange and the creation of information-rich networks. In these networks, all the essential properties of information are clearly manifested, from inexhaustible copying possibilities to the ability to convey the same knowledge in entirely different ways. At this historical moment, the shift of focus from tangible goods and benefits to information has become evident to everyone. However, the unique properties of information and knowledge have not yet sufficiently influenced the economy, which is built on entirely different key positions, such as resource exhaustibility and competition for it.</p><p>Only the inexhaustibility of information and the accessibility of knowledge can quench the thirst for the new and unknown that burns in the minds of modern people, intoxicated by progress. Universalization will serve as a reliable beacon in the vast expanses of information networks, and cooperation will help uncover the value of every grain of new knowledge, turning them into valuable experiences of collaboration and visible results of joint creativity.</p><p>In conclusion, the proposed shift to a new value system, based on Universalization, Cooperation, and Creativity, is not just an alternative to the current state of affairs, but a necessary evolution for humanity. This shift marks a departure from the limitations of tangible goods and the competition they incite, and a move towards the boundless world of information and knowledge. By embracing this change, we can quench our collective thirst for the new and unknown, and harness the boundless potential of human creativity. This is not just a vision for a better future; it is a call to action for every individual, every community, and humanity as a whole. The time for change is now. Let us embrace these principles and together, we can redefine the course of human civilization.</p>',13),s=[o];function r(l,c,h,d,u,f){return t(),i("div",null,s)}const v=e(a,[["render",r]]);export{m as __pageData,v as default};
