Skills tend to transfer and help learn more and faster. Once you master a number of skills you can get into the flow of switching and learning crafts that reinforce each other. Creating complex projects needs dozens of diverse tasks. Being able to take and complete all of them for at least a small project is the aquisition of creative independence.
