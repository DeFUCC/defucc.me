    title: Universalization
    desc: Realisation of any subject's will to acquire practical experience in multilateral study of the whole in existence.
    color: "#f90"
    context: Learning something new always opens unusual ways to see things and perform actions. Mastering a craft is crucial for being full-fledged part of modern society. Aquiring a second craft is a little easier as you already have some real life experience. Skills tend to transfer and help learn more and faster. Once you master a number of skills you can get into the flow of switching and learning crafts that reinforce each other. Creating complex projects needs dozens of diverse tasks. Being able to take and complete all of them for at least a small project is the aquisition of creative independence. Multilateral universally experienced creators are more of an ideal. People exploring something they've been passing by before is the reality we can bring together.

    title: Cooperation
    desc: Sum of individual efforts to complete otherwise impossible tasks
    color: "#f00"
    context: It's a pleasure to work together on projects that really matter for the participants and others. Self-motivated and self-coordinated social action can accomplish almost anything. The more independent and universally experienced people are involved, the more complex projects may be realized collaboratively. Some may be there to learn, some will find new friends, some will just make use of the results at the end. It's so fun to build something for the good of others and us together.

    title: Creativity
    desc: Conscious improvement of reality
    color: "#070"
    context: To really create something is to deliberately apply free efforts to increase the subjective world perfection. People are able to envision ideal forms of things. And it helps them find ways to get a step towards unaccessable ultimate beauty. Creators find this as an endless journey for life.

<p>
The DeFUCC Foundation is a non-formal non-profit organization whose goal is to promote universalization, cooperation, and creativity in individuals and society.
</p><p>
Since 2012, we have conducted wide research, developed socio-cultural programs, and implemented them to the best of our abilities. We gather and summarize a wide range of theoretical and practical experience, and aim to share these valuable insights with the world. We openly systematize this knowledge into a unified system, yet it is not a dogma, but rather a starting point for those who wish to join us in the process of transforming ourselves and the world around us.
</p><p>
To move towards clear goals in a coordinated manner, it is important that we understand each other. For this reason, we develop a special language for productive communication, the Fruit Discourse. The economic model of the Fund's development is based on the principles of voluntary participation and mutual support.
