    title: Universalization
    desc: Realisation of any subject's will to acquire practical experience in multilateral study of the whole in existence.
    color: "#f90"
    context: Learning something new always opens unusual ways to see things and perform actions. Mastering a craft is crucial for being full-fledged part of modern society. Aquiring a second craft is a little easier as you already have some real life experience. Skills tend to transfer and help learn more and faster. Once you master a number of skills you can get into the flow of switching and learning crafts that reinforce each other. Creating complex projects needs dozens of diverse tasks. Being able to take and complete all of them for at least a small project is the aquisition of creative independence. Multilateral universally experienced creators are more of an ideal. People exploring something they've been passing by before is the reality we can bring together.

    title: Cooperation
    desc: Sum of individual efforts to complete otherwise impossible tasks
    color: "#f00"
    context: It's a pleasure to work together on projects that really matter for the participants and others. Self-motivated and self-coordinated social action can accomplish almost anything. The more independent and universally experienced people are involved, the more complex projects may be realized collaboratively. Some may be there to learn, some will find new friends, some will just make use of the results at the end. It's so fun to build something for the good of others and us together.

    title: Creativity
    desc: Conscious improvement of reality
    color: "#070"
    context: To really create something is to deliberately apply free efforts to increase the subjective world perfection. People are able to envision ideal forms of things. And it helps them find ways to get a step towards unaccessable ultimate beauty. Creators find this as an endless journey for life.

<p>
The DeFUCC Foundation is a non-formal non-profit organization whose goal is to promote universalization, cooperation, and creativity in individuals and society.</p>
<p>
Since 2012, we have been conducting wide research and developed a number of socio-cultural programs and are implementing them for the best of humankind. We gather and summarize a range of theoretical and practical experience, and aim to share these valuable insights with the world. Our role is to invent, verify and polish new forms of human social activities, that can benefit communities all over the world. We openly systematize this knowledge into a unified system, which is not a dogma, but rather a starting point for those who wish to join us in the journey of transforming ourselves and the world around us.</p>
<p>
The purpose of establishing the foundation is to find ways to fund at least a part of these undertakings in a way that they stay open source and available for general public. This means that at some moment of time anyone can get involved into socio-cultural project development. Eventually people around and the society as a whole will recognize the benefits from these enterprises and new ways of meaningful connections between community sponsors and beneficiaries will evolve as a new real world social networks.</p>
<p>
To move towards clear goals in a coordinated manner, it is important to understand each other well. For this reason, we develop a special language for productive communication, the Fruit Discourse. The social model of the Fund's development is based on the principles of voluntary participation and mutual support. And it's economy is based on prehistorical gift exchange practices reimagined with modern p2p technologies evolving.</p>

<p>Technology is a heavy burden despite the benefits on it's sharp edge. And there's enough of it to build globally interconnected self-governing communities joining collaboration on bringing harmony to Earth. We just need to use it right, which means use the devices as means to communicate and collaborate with others in real life.</p>
